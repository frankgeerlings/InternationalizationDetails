# What is 'InternationalizationDetails'?

When it comes to internationalization (i18n) there are a lot of details to be dealt with. This library intends to deal with some of them.

Currently, there is a single class that converts IDN e-mail addresses to their wire-safe counterparts.

I'm not entirely happy with the API yet, so expect it to change. Improvements and additions are welcome of course.
